### Project Details
The dashboard consists of a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a panel displaying an individual's demographic information. Users can select a sample from the dropdown menu, and the dashboard will update the charts and demographic information accordingly.

### Technologies Used
- D3
- JavaScript
- HTML

### Conclusion
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the dataset and gain insights into the microbial species colonizing human navels. Users can quickly visualize the top 10 OTUs found in a selected individual and compare them with other samples, enhancing the understanding of the biodiversity in the human navel, for example dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
